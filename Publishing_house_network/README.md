# Publishing House Network

*Letâ€™s consider a publishing house which has to commission a translation, how should it select a valid translator?*

In this project defined a simple **Bayesian network** to explore the world of uncertainty using **pgmpy** and **networkx**.    
I started by defining the conditional probability distributions of my model, and I analyzed the independence relations among my network nodes.  
Then, I compared 3 approximate inference methods (**Weighted Likelihood, Rejection Sampling, Gibbs Sampling**) using the exact inference as a baseline.
