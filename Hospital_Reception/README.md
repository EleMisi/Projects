# Hospital Reception 
Hospital Reception is a project realized as part of the *Econophysics* exam of the [Master's degree in Physics of Complex Systems,  University of Turin](https://fisica-sc.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl).

The aim of this project is to apply the queueing theory on an ideal hospital reception using an **agent-based simulation**.

The reception is modeled as a **M/M/c queue** and with the simulation it's possibile to test different **arrivals rate** and **service rate** configurations.

See the [project review](https://terna.to.it/tesineEconofisica/HospitalReception.pdf) for more details.

## Run the Simulation
Click [here](https://eleonoramisino.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HospitalReception-NetLogoWebVersion-1.html) to run the simulation on your browser.

Read the *Model Info* of the simulation to find the operating instruction (**HOW TO USE IT** section).

If you'd like to modify the model, just click on the *Mode* button at the top-left corner to switch to the *Authoring mode*.


## Simulation Overview
The reception is displayed on the left, while on the right you can find:
* the chart A showing the total number of patients and the number of waiting patients;
* the chart B showing the average time spent in queue;
* the value of  *Rho*, which is strictly related to the **equilibrium condition** of our system.
