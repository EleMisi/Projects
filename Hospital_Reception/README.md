# Hospital Reception 
A simple example of queueing theory applied on an ideal hospital reception using an agent-based simulation.
The model has been implemented with [NetLogo v6.0.4](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml).

Further information on this project can be found on my [website](https://eleonoramisino.altervista.org/hospital-reception/), where you can also run the model.
