# Fruit Inspection Project

We analyze some fruit images to detect potential imperfections.

We perform **image segmentation** using the *Otsu's method* and we apply the **Canny Edge Detector** to locate the imperfections.  
We refine our result applying the **erosion operation** and we finally draw the detected defects.

*The analyzed images in `images` folder are kindly provided by [UNITEC S.p.a.](http://www.unitec-group.com/) and they are part of the dataset used in the course 91254 - Image Processing and Computer Vision - University of Bologna.
