# Fruit Inspection 

I analyzed some fruit images to detect potential imperfections.

I performed **image segmentation** using the *Otsu's method* and I applied the **Canny Edge Detector** to locate the imperfections.  
I refined my results applying the **erosion operation** and I finally drew the detected defects.
